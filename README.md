### Observations:
- One thing globally common about "age" is, people above 70 years of age have high chances of death if infected due to covid 19.
- For people less than 70 years of age, race and gender seems to have some relation to covid infections but I feel the root cause is "OCCUPATION". The only reason why young generation is affected is due to continued exposure to virus. The occupation chart shows how the lower level job workers have high chance of getting infected.
- Now, the workers may be of any race, gender and young age group. if you check, the global data, different races are affected by covid. There is no pattern associated to a particular race or gender.
